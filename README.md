Fake API for fetching users

#Known Issues & Considerations

Login Delay: After login, there may be a slight delay due to async state updates. If the screen does not change immediately, wait a second or refresh the page.

Pagination Limitations: If the API response is slow, the next page might take a moment to load.

Mock Backend: The user data is fetched from a mock API, so edits and deletions are not persistent.
